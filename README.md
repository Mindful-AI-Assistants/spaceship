# Spaceship Titanic Prediction

This project is an entry for the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic", where we predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly.

## Project Description

In this competition, we use machine learning techniques to analyze the recovered records from the Spaceship Titanic's damaged computer system and predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.
