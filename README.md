# ðŸš€ Spaceship Titanic Prediction - Kaggle Competition


This competition runs indefinitely with a rolling leaderboard. [Learn more](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/competitions#getting-started).

Welcome to the Spaceship 

Titanic repository! This project is an entry for the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic", where we predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly.


## ðŸ“Š Project Description
In this competition, we use machine learning techniques to analyze the recovered records from the Spaceship Titanic's damaged computer system and predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.

## Dataset

The dataset includes passenger information such as:
- Age
- Home Planet
- Cabin
- Destination
- VIP status
- Expenditures on various amenities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code is written in Python 3.

### Required Libraries

Install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spaceship-titanic.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd spaceship-titanic
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the entire pipeline
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for data cleaning and feature engineering
- `model.py`: Contains the machine learning model and related functions
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the data to gain insights
3. Model Selection: Trying various models and selecting the best performer
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model parameters
5. Prediction: Generating predictions for the test set

## Results

(Describe your model's performance, any interesting findings, and your final competition score)

## Future Work

- Try ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy
- Explore deep learning approaches
- Conduct more in-depth feature engineering
